Burhan Aydeniz - Visiosoft Job Application Task 2022

In this project, two tasks requested by Visiosoft during the job application process were completed.

All tasks were completed on Google Colab platfrom for ease of computational power. By using VisiosoftAppTask.ipynb file, all tasks can be reached. Also, trained model can be downloaded by using model_trained.pth file.
